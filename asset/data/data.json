Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",
                "abstract":"A promising way to mitigate inequality is by addressing students’ worries about belonging. But where and with whom is this social-belonging intervention effective? Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

Feedback processes such as supernova explosions enrich the gas with elements heavier than helium and can impart enough momentum to eject some gas out of the galaxy. S. Zhang et al. observed the intergalactic medium around a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3. In addition to emission lines caused by hydrogen and helium, they observed lines for carbon, indicating that the gas has been enriched with heavier elements. The kinematics are consistent with streams of gas spiraling toward the massive galaxy. The authors propose that the enriched gas has been recycled from an earlier period of star formation. —Keith T. Smith",
                "abstract":"Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly.",

Holycross and Cottrell tested this hypothesis by running a series of experiments to determine how garnet formation changes the amount and speciation of iron. They found that garnet does not have a large impact and is unlikely to be the sole cause of the oxidation of arc lavas. The observed chemistry requires a different explanation. —Brent Grocholski",

Garnet crystallization could explain these observations if garnet removes substantial amounts of Fe<sip>2+</sup>,, but not Fe<sup>3+</sup>, from magma, yet this model for continental crust generation has never been tested experimentally. Analysis of garnets and melts in laboratory experiments show that the compatibilities of Fe<sip>2+</sup> and Fe<sip>3+</sup> in garnet are of similar magnitudes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing cumulates will remove 22 % of total Fe from primary arc basalts but negligibly alter the Fe<sip>3+</sup>/∑Fe ratio and fO2 of the melt. Garnet crystallization is unlikely to be responsible for the relatively oxidized nature of basaltic arc magmas or the Fe-depletion trend observed in continental crust.",

Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission electron microscopy, the researchers took images of the system once a second and analyzed the observed changes in string configurations. The system underwent a crossover between a low-temperature regime with limited string motion to a high-temperature one characterized by changes in string topology. —Jelena Stajic",

We studied a model nanomagnetic array in which such constraints visibly affect the behavior of the magnetic moments. In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.",

To reveal which factor is responsible for this process and to understand the molecular mechanism of stop codon recognition, Saurer et al. used a combination of gene editing, ribosomal profiling and cryo–electron microscopy to investigate the termination process in vivo and in vitro. The specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codon by the identified release factor results in a distortion of the messenger RNA and requires participation of the ribosomal RNA, a recognition mechanism that was not observed for canonical termination complexes. —Di Jiang",

Mitochondrial genomes feature deviations from the standard genetic code, including the reassignment of two arginine codons to stop codons. The protein required for translation termination at these noncanonical stop codons to release the newly synthesized polypeptides is not currently known. In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo–electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.",
